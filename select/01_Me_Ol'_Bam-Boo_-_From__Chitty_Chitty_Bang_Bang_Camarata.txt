A gentleman's got a walking stick
A seaman's got a gaff
And the merry men of Robin Hood
They used a quarterstaff

On the Spanish plains inside their canes
They hide their ruddy swords
But we make do with an old bamboo
And everyone applauds

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, hey
Me ol' bam-boo, me ol' bamboo
You'd better never bother with me ol' bamboo
You can have me hat or me bum-ber-shoo
But you'd better never bother with me ol' bamboo

When punting on the beautiful Thames
You use a sturdy pole
To protect their fair complexion
Ladies use a parasol

It's useful in the underbrush
To have a hefty spear
Right

But what we do with an old bamboo
Makes everybody cheer
1, 2, 3, ho

Me ol' bam-boo, me ol' bam-boo
You'd better never bother with me ol' bamboo
You can have me hat or me bum-ber-shoo
But you'd better never bother with me ol' bamboo

'Ere we go, mate

A flyer in an air-e-o-plane
He steers it with a stick
He does?

A collier in the pits o' Wales
He leans upon his pick
That's right

Now every wheel of an automobile
Revolves around a shaft
(Hey)
But what we do with an old bamboo
Makes everyone go daft
And 1, 2

Me ol' bam-boo, me ol' bamboo
You'd better never bother with me ol' bamboo
You can have me hat or me bum-ber-shoo
But you'd better never bother with me ol' bamboo

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, hey
And a 1, 2, 3, 4 and a 5 and a 6 and a 7, ho
Me ol' bam-boo, me ol' bam-boo
You'd better never bother with me ol' bamboo
You can have me hat or me bum ber shoo

But you'd better never bother with me ol' bamboo
You'd better never bother with me ol' bamboo
